/**
 * <p>Interledger Payments moves assets of one party to another that consists of one or more ledger
 * transfers, potentially across multiple ledgers.</p>
 *
 * <p>Interledger Payments have three major consumers:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Connectors utilize the Interledger Address contained in the payment to route the
 * payment.</li>
 * <li>The receiver of a payment uses it to identify the recipient and which condition to
 * fulfill.</li>
 * <li>Interledger sub-protocols utilize custom data encoded in a payment to facilitate
 * sub-protocol operations.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When a sender prepares a transfer to start a payment, the sender attaches an ILP Payment to
 * the transfer, in the memo field if possible. If a ledger does not support attaching the entire ILP Payment to a
 * transfer as a memo, users of that ledger can transmit the ILP Payment using another authenticated messaging channel,
 * but MUST be able to correlate transfers and ILP Payments.</p>
 *
 * <p>When a connector sees an incoming prepared transfer with an ILP Payment, the receiver reads
 * the ILP Payment to confirm the details of the packet. For example, the connector reads the InterledgerAddress of the
 * payment's receiver, and if the connector has a route to the receiver's account, the connector prepares a transfer to
 * continue the payment, and attaches the same ILP Payment to the new transfer. Likewise, the receiver confirms that the
 * amount of the ILP Payment Packet matches the amount actually delivered by the transfer. And finally, the receiver
 * decodes the data portion of the Payment and matches the condition to the payment.</p>
 *
 * <p>The receiver MUST confirm the integrity of the ILP Payment, for example with a hash-based
 * message authentication code (HMAC). If the receiver finds the transfer acceptable, the receiver releases the
 * fulfillment for the transfer, which can be used to execute all prepared transfers that were established prior to the
 * receiver accepting the payment.</p>
