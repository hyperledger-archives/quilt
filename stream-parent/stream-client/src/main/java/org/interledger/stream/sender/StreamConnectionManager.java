/**
 * <p>Manages all STREAM connections across this JVM.</p>
 *
 * <p>Connection management in STREAM is somewhat complicated by the fact that connection identifiers can be derived
 * from a destination address and shared secret. These values are often stored in a sender and/or receiver, so it can be
 * easy for implementations to accidentally re-use connection identifiers without knowing it.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, a Stream Sender that allows for simultaneous calls to `sendMoney` might guard its internal sequence
 * to make it thread-safe, but another instance might accidentally be constructed at the same time. These two
 * implementations' sequence might collide in this case.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides a JVM-wide location to open and close connections so that no two instances of a
 * Stream sender or receiver accidentally use sequences that might overlap. While this implementation does not guard
 * against two classes in _different_ JVMs using the same destination address and secret, and thus potentially
 * colliding, this possibility is considered to be extremely remote since the chances of two different JVMs using the
 * same shared secret are considered to be remote. However, care should be taken when designing clustered STREAM senders
 * and receivers because it is possible that certain implementations of Stream Receiver might return the same shared
 * secret if queried more than once using the same receiver address.</p>
 *
 * @deprecated Prefer {@link org.interledger.stream.connection.StreamConnectionManager} instead.
