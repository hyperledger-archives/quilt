# Interledger Core  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/hyperledger/quilt/ilp-core.svg)](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ailp-core)

Base library for Interledger projects providing service interfaces, event descriptions, exceptions and data models.

For more information about Interledger specifications that underpin this library, please reference [https://github.com/interledger/rfcs](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs).

## Usage
For more detail about how to use this library, consult the [wiki](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/wiki)

The library offers interfaces for all core objects and default builders that produce immutable instances of these objects.

The library also offers a codecs for encoding and decoding the objects according to the ASN.1 specifications and OER (Octet encoding rules).


### Interledger Address

Interledger Addresses can be created from a String and then manipulated using utility functions

```java
//Create a new address (short form)
InterledgerAddress address = InterledgerAddress.of("private.bob");

//Create a new address (long form)
InterledgerAddress destinationAddress = InterledgerAddress.builder()
  .value("private.bob")
  .build();

//Check if an address starts with a specific prefix
if( address.startsWith("test") ) {
  //Testnet address...
}

```

### Conditions and Fulfillments

Conditions can be derived from a fullfillment or directly from the underlying hash

```java
//Create a fulfillment from a pre-image of 32-bytes (short form)
Fulfillment fulfillment = Fulfillment.of(preimage);

//Create a fulfillment from a pre-image of 32-bytes (long form)
Fulfillment fulfillment = Fulfillment.builder()
  .preimage(preimage)
  .build();

//Get Condition from Fulfillment
Condition condition = fulfillment.getCondition();

//Create Condition (short form)
Condition condition1 = Condition.of(hash);

//Create Condition (long form)
Condition condition1 = Condition.builder()
  .hash(hash)
  .build();
```

### Interledger Payment packet

```java

// Build ILP Payment Packet
InterledgerPayment payment = InterledgerPayment.builder()
  .destinationAccount(address)
  .destinationAmount(destinationAmount)
  .data(data)
  .build();
```

### Interledger Payment Request

```java

InterledgerPaymentRequest ipr = InterledgerPaymentRequest.builder()
  .payment(payment)
  .condition(condition)
  .build();
```

### Pre-Shared Key protocol

The PSK protocol defines an envelope format for the data in an ILP Payment packet but also a number
of algorithms for deriving various keys and secrets based on a single receiver secret.

The PSK Context is created using the receiver secret (on the receiver side) or just the shared key
on the sender side. A sender side context cannot be used to derive a receiverId and has no random
token so calling either `getToken()` or `getReceiverId()` will throw.

See [ILP-RFC 16](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0016-pre-shared-key/) for more details of PSK

```java
// Create a new context at the receiver and seed with a new random token
PskContext context = PskContext.seed(SECRET);

//Load a context from an incoming payment using the token extracted from the destination address
in the payment
PskContext receiverContext =
    PskContext.fromReceiverAddress(SECRET, incomingPayment.getDestinationAccount());

//Load a context from the shared key provided to the sender during the SPSP exchange
PskContext senderPskContext = PskContext.fromPreSharedKey(psk);

//Create a PSK Message
PskMessage pskMessage = PskMessage.builder()
  .paymentId(paymentId)
  .expiry(expiry)
  .addPrivateHeader("Secret", secretStuff)
  .data(data)
  .build();

// Encrypt message
PskMessage encryptedPskMessage = context.encryptMessage(pskMessage);

// Decrypt message
PskMessage decryptedPskMessage = context.decryptMessage(encryptedPskMessage);

```

For a full end-to-end test demonstrating all of these functions see:

## Development
We welcome any and all submissions, whether it's a typo, bug fix, or new feature.

### Requirements
This project uses Gradle to manage dependencies and other aspects of the build.  To install Gradle, follow the instructions at [https://gradle.org](https://gradle.org/).

### Get the code

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt
cd quilt/ilp-core
```

### Build the Project
To build the project, execute the following command:

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

#### Checkstyle
The project uses checkstyle to keep code style consistent. All Checkstyle checks are run by default during the build, but if you would like to run checkstyle checks, use the following command:

```bash
$ mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

### Contributing
This project utilizes a Pull Request submission model.  Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your build passes with no test failures nor Checkstyle errors.
