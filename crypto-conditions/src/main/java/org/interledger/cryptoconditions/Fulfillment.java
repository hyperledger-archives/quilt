   * <p>Validation of a fulfillment (F) against a condition (C) and a message (M), in the majority
   * of cases, follows the steps below.</p>
   *
   * <p>1.  The implementation must derive a condition from the fulfillment and ensure that the
   * derived condition (D) matches the given condition (C).</p>
   *
   * <p>2.  If the fulfillment is a simple crypto-condition AND is based upon a signature scheme
   * (such as RSA-PSS or ED25519) then any signatures in the fulfillment (F) must be verified, using
   * the appropriate signature verification algorithm, against the corresponding public key, also
   * provided in the fulfillment and the message (M) (which may be empty).</p>
   *
   * <p>3. If the fulfillment is a compound crypto-condition then the sub-fulfillments MUST each be
   * validated.  In the case of the PREFIX-SHA-256 type, the sub-fulfillment MUST be valid for (F)
   * to be valid. In the case of the THRESHOLD-SHA-256 type, the number of valid sub-fulfillments
   * must be equal or greater than the threshold defined in (F).</p>
   *
   * <p>If the derived condition (D) matches the input condition (C) AND the boolean circuit defined
   * by the fulfillment evaluates to TRUE then the fulfillment (F) fulfills the condition (C).</p>
   *
   * <p>A more detailed validation algorithm for each crypto-condition type is provided in the
   * Javadoc of each {@link #verify(Condition, byte[])} method. In each case the notation F.x or C.y
   * implies the decoded value of the field named x from the fulfillment and the decoded value of
   * the field named y from the Condition, respectively.</p>
   *
   * @param condition A {@link Condition} that this fulfillment should verify.
   * @param message   An optionally-empty byte array that, if present, is part of validating the
   *                  supplied condition.
   *
   * @return {@code true} if this fulfillment validates the supplied condition and message; {@code
   *     false} otherwise.
