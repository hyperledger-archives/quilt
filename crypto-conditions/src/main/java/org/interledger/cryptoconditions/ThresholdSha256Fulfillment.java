  /**
   * <p>Constructs an instance of {@link ThresholdSha256Fulfillment}.</p>
   *
   * <p>Per the spec, this method will imply the threshold based upon the number of sub-fulfillments
   * present in {@code subfulfillments}. This logic can be confusing, especially when trying to
   * construct threshold fulfillments that are only partially, yet validly, fulfilled.</p>
   *
   * <p>For example, if there exists a 1-of-2 {@link ThresholdSha256Condition} (i.e., Threshold =
   * 1), then it might be tempting to assume that there exists several threshold fulfillments that
   * could be verified by such a condition. The most obvious candidate is a 2-of-2 threshold
   * fulfillment, which could be constructed using this method by supplying zero sub-conditions and
   * two sub-fulfillments. However, in reality, such a sub-fulfillment (the 2-of-2) would not verify
   * with a 1-of-2 threshold condition because a threshold fulfillment created with two
   * sub-fulfillments <b>always</b> has a threshold of two.</p>
   *
   * <p>Because usage of this method always involves an inferred threshold, which might be
   * unexpected, it is recommended that callers utilize helper methods from {@link ThresholdFactory}
   * instead.</p>
   *
   * <p>Concurrency Note: This method will create a shallow-copy of both {@code subconditions} and
   * {@code subfulfillments} before performing any operations, in order to guard against external
   * list mutations. During the brief period of time that this method is shallow-copying, callers
   * should not consider this method to be thread-safe. This is because another thread could mutate
   * the lists (e.g., by adding or removing a sub-condition), which may cause unpredictable
   * behavior. In addition, this method assumes the sub-condition and sub-fulfillment
   * implementations are immutable, making shallow-copy operations sufficient to protect against
   * external list mutation. However, if your environment uses mutable implementations of either
   * {@link Condition} or {@link Fulfillment}, such shallow-copying may not be sufficient.</p>
   *
   * @param subconditions   An ordered {@link List} of unfulfilled sub-conditions that correspond to
   *                        the threshold condition being fulfilled. For example, if a given
   *                        Threshold condition has 2 preimage sub-conditions, but a threshold of 1,
   *                        then a valid fulfillment would have one of those preimage conditions in
   *                        this List, and a fulfillment for the other preimage condition in the
   *                        {@code fulfillments} list. Note that this list must be combined with the
   *                        list of conditions derived from the subfulfillments, and the combined
   *                        list, sorted, is used as the value when deriving the fingerprint of this
   *                        threshold fulfillment.
   * @param subfulfillments An ordered {@link List} of sub-fulfillments.  The number of elements in
   *                        this list is equal to the threshold of this fulfillment (i.e., per the
   *                        crypto-condtions specification, implementations must use the length of
   *                        this list as the threshold value when deriving the fingerprint of this
   *                        crypto-condition).
   *
   * @return A newly created, immutable instance of {@link ThresholdSha256Fulfillment}.
