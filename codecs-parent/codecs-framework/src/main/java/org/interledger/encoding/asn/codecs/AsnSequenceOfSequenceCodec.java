    // use-case for this functionality is the encoding/decoding of STREAM frames, and there generally aren't more than
    // a few frames in any given STREAM packet). Therefore, this implementation starts with a small array, but allows
    // the array to grow dynamically as needed.
    // This design preferable to simply constructing an array with a length equal to the length supplied in the ASN.1
    // OER packet, because this could lead to a potential DOS attack if an attacker were to maliciously specify an
    // artificially long length value.
    // For example, a malicious packet creator could specify a length value of Integer.MAX_VALUE, which a naive decoder
    // would use to initialize an array, thus accidentially allocating 2GB of JVM heap. This likely would result in an
    // OutOfMemoryError depending on the default heap size of the JVM. Instead, the chosen design which dynamically
    // allocates the array based upon actual byte counts avoids this potential attack vector.
