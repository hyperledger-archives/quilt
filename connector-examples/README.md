# Interledger Connector Examples
This project contains examples of Interledger Connectors that are built using various f
rameworks, such as [Spring](https://spring.io/), [Vertx](http://vertx.io/), and others. 

The intention of the connector projects in this folder is to both provide reference 
implementations of an Interledger Connector, while at the same time illustrate the flexibility 
of the ILP Core components by showing how they can be wired into a diversity of existing Java 
frameworks and technologies.
